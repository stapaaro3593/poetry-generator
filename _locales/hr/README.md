To code this project yourself, right click on the background of the workspace and choose ‘delete all blocks’, then follow the coding video below. You can find the `forever` and `on start` blocks in the `Basic` section.

### Što je to?

The poetry generator project creates random phrases that you can use in a poem, as a password or to start a story. It's nice to share especially poetic or funny phrases with your friends.

### What will you learn?

You will learn about **arrays**, a special kind of variable. **Arrays** are a useful way of storing data in lists.

### Kako to radi

* When you shake your BBC micro:bit, a random phrase is created that consists of an adjective, noun, verb, then adverb, for example, ‘beautiful bird eats swiftly’.
* You can either use your phrase to start a poem or alongside other phrases generated by this program to write an entire poem.
* The program uses four **arrays** called ‘adjectives’, ‘nouns’, ‘verbs’, and ‘adverbs’.
* Each array stores a list of words. Each item in an array is called an **element**. The elements are numbered with an **index**. For example, the array ‘noun’ includes three elements: element 0, bird; element 1, butterfly; and element 2, dragonfly. The indices are numbered from 0 because computers start counting at 0.
* When you shake your micro:bit, a random number between 0 and 2 is chosen for each array. The elements for those indices are shown on the micro:bit’s LED display.
